## Description
This is an Microsoft Windows program to extract Level 7 (admin) username and password data from an Ericsson/Aastra MD110 PABX.
It works by decoding the data backup file for LIM 1 so physical access is needed to obtain this file. <br>

## Source code

This repository contains the source code files to build that application and data files:

* `L001.bc10`       - A LIM 1 data file for the BC10 release.
* `L001.bc13`       - A LIM 1 data file for the BC13 release.
* `L001.horsham`    - A LIM 1 data file for the BC13 release.
